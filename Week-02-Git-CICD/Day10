Day 10 — Git Stash, Git Reset & GitHub Usage

What I Learned

git stash temporarily saves uncommitted work so I can switch branches safely.

Stashes allow me to pause work-in-progress without committing.

git stash pop restores changes and removes the stash entry.

git reset is used to undo commits or remove changes from history.

--soft, --mixed, and --hard reset each behave differently:

soft → undo commit, keep staged

mixed → undo commit, keep changes

hard → remove commit + changes (dangerous)


GitHub is used for hosting repositories, collaboration, PRs, CI/CD pipelines, and code reviews.

Pushing branches and creating pull requests is the standard workflow for merging clean code into main.


Commands / Code

# ----------- GIT STASH -------------

git stash               # save uncommitted changes
git stash list          # show all stashes
git stash apply         # bring back changes but keep stash
git stash pop           # bring back changes and remove stash
git stash drop stash@{0}  # delete a specific stash

# ----------- GIT RESET -------------

git reset --soft HEAD~1  # undo last commit, keep staged
git reset HEAD~1         # undo commit, keep changes unstaged
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # delete commit + changes permanently (dangerous)

# ----------- GITHUB USAGE -------------

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
git push -u origin main        # push code to GitHub
git pull                       # download latest changes
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git  # clone repo

git checkout -b feature-login  # create and switch to new branch
git push origin feature-login  # push feature branch to GitHub

# Pull Requests are created using GitHub UI

Notes

git stash is useful when switching tasks or fixing urgent bugs without losing work.

Always check git stash list before applying or popping.

git reset --hard should never be used on a shared/pushed branch.

GitHub PR workflow ensures clean merges and proper review.

GitHub is essential for DevOps pipelines (CI/CD), automation, Docker builds, and version control of infrastructure.

A common DevOps workflow:


Feature Branch → Commit → Push → Pull Request → Review → Merge
