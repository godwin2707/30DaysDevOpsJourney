Day 9 — Branching & Merging in Git

What I Learned

Branches allow parallel development without affecting main code.

main or master is usually the production or stable branch.

New features or fixes should be created in separate branches.

git add → git commit → git push saves and uploads code.

Pull Requests (PR) are used in GitHub to merge code with review.

Merging brings branch changes back into the main codebase.

Merge conflicts occur when multiple changes affect the same lines.

Conflicts must be resolved manually, then committed.

Commands / Code
# Check branches
git branch

# Create a new branch
git branch feature1

# Create & switch to branch (recommended)
git checkout -b feature1

# Switch branches
git checkout main
git checkout feature1

# Make changes and commit
echo "New feature" >> file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Added new feature"

# Merge feature branch into main
git checkout main
git merge feature1

# Delete branch after merge
git branch -d feature1

# Push branch to GitHub
git push origin feature1

# List remotes
git remote -v

Notes

git commit saves locally, while git push uploads to GitHub.

Push sends your branch to GitHub, but merging still requires a Pull Request.

Pull Request (PR) = request to merge branch changes into main.

Useful workflow for teams:

Create branch → Work → Commit → Push branch → PR → Review → Merge


Merge conflicts appear when the same lines change in both branches, resolved manually.

Git branching is core to collaborative DevOps development and CI/CD pipelines.
