Day 5 — Process Management & Background Jobs

What I Learned

A process is a running program in memory. Linux allows monitoring, killing, prioritizing, and handling them.

ps shows current running processes, while ps aux displays all processes in detail.

grep is used with ps to filter specific processes (e.g., ps aux | grep nginx).

top shows live, real-time system usage (CPU, memory, load).

htop is an improved, interactive version of top with colors and UI.

kill stops processes using their PID; kill -9 force-kills stubborn processes.

nice and renice change process priority to manage CPU usage.

Background tasks can be started with & and controlled using jobs, fg, and bg.

Commands / Code
# View processes
ps                           # current processes
ps aux                       # detailed list of all processes
ps aux | grep firefox        # filter specific process

# Monitor system in real-time
top                          # live process monitor
sudo apt install htop
htop                         # advanced monitor with UI

# Kill process
kill PID                     # normal kill
kill -9 PID                  # force kill (unsafe but effective)

# Process priority
nice -n 10 program.sh        # start with lower priority
renice -n 5 -p PID           # change priority of a running process

# Background jobs
command &                    # run in background
jobs                         # list background jobs
fg %1                        # bring job to foreground
bg %1                        # resume job in background

Notes

ps aux gives a snapshot view, while htop is live updating.

Use ps aux | grep <name> to find PIDs for services you want to monitor or kill.

STAT field examples:

R = Running

S = Sleeping

Z = Zombie

T = Stopped

+ = Foreground process

Background tasks continue running even after terminal input stops.

kill -9 force kills and should be used carefully to avoid data loss.

Changing priority (nice, renice) helps prevent system slowdowns during heavy tasks.
