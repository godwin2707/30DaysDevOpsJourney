Day 6 — Disk Usage & Networking Commands

What I Learned

df and du help check disk usage and identify heavy directories or files.

df -h displays storage capacity, used/available space in human-readable format.

du -sh shows how large a directory is, useful for cleanup and debugging storage issues.

Logs and cache often consume space, and sudo apt clean helps free disk cache.

Networking commands like ping, nslookup, ss, and curl are essential for connectivity and service troubleshooting.

ping checks if a host is reachable, nslookup/dig resolves domain names to IPs.

ss -tulpn inspects open ports and running network services.

curl allows testing API endpoints and server responses from the terminal.

ip a and ip route help examine IP configuration and routing.

Commands / Code
# Disk usage
df -h                         # display disk usage in human-readable size
du -sh folder/                # size of a directory
du -h --max-depth=1           # compare sizes of subdirectories
find / -type f -size +500M    # find large files in system
sudo apt clean                # clean apt cache to free space

# Networking
ping google.com               # test connectivity
nslookup google.com           # DNS lookup
dig google.com                # detailed DNS information
ss -tulpn                     # list open listening ports
ip a                          # show network interfaces & IP addresses
ip route                      # show routing table
curl https://example.com      # fetch webpage or API response
curl -I https://example.com   # fetch only headers

Notes

df gives disk view at filesystem level, du gives disk view at directory/file level.

Checking /var/log, /home, and /tmp is common when space runs low.

Logs, cache, backups, and container images often consume large space in servers.

ping works on ICMP protocol, useful for connectivity but not HTTP status.

curl is ideal for API/URL testing and debugging (headers, status codes, response).

ss is a modern replacement for netstat to inspect ports & active connections.

Understanding both disk and networking commands is necessary for server troubleshooting and monitoring in DevOps.
