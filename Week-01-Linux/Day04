Day 4 — Package Managers (apt, yum, dnf)
What I Learned

A package manager is used to install, update, remove, and manage software in Linux.

apt is used in Debian/Ubuntu systems, yum and dnf are used in RedHat/CentOS/Fedora.

apt update downloads the latest package list (metadata) — it does not install updates.

apt install downloads .deb packages and installs them using dpkg internally.

Installed packages can be upgraded using apt upgrade.

Repository sources are stored in /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/.

Downloaded package metadata is stored in /var/lib/apt/lists/.

.deb installation packages are stored temporarily in /var/cache/apt/archives/.

yum and dnf work similarly to apt but are used on RPM-based distributions.

Package managers make installation simple by handling dependencies automatically.

Commands / Code
# APT (Debian/Ubuntu/Kali)
sudo apt update                    # refresh package list
sudo apt upgrade                   # upgrade installed packages
sudo apt install package_name      # install package
sudo apt remove package_name       # uninstall package
apt search package_name            # search for package
apt show package_name              # show package details

# Package locations
cat /etc/apt/sources.list          # repo URLs
ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d/        # additional repo configs
ls /var/lib/apt/lists              # downloaded package metadata
ls /var/cache/apt/archives         # downloaded .deb packages

# YUM (older RHEL/CentOS)
sudo yum install package_name
sudo yum update
sudo yum remove package_name

# DNF (Fedora/new RHEL systems)
sudo dnf install package_name
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf remove package_name


Notes

apt update ≠ updates applications, it only updates package index.

apt upgrade installs new package versions present in index.

APT checks $PATH to find the apt binary in /usr/bin/apt.

apt uses repository URLs to fetch metadata and .deb files.

.deb files are downloaded from remote servers and cached locally.

Package managers prevent dependency issues and make installation easier than manual compilation.
