Day 7 — Bash Scripting Basics (Variables, Loops, Conditions)

What I Learned

Bash scripting is used to automate commands, deployments, server tasks, CI/CD jobs, cron jobs, and DevOps workflows.

A Bash script starts with a shebang (#!/bin/bash) to tell the system which interpreter to use.

Variables store values inside scripts and are referenced with $variable.

export makes a variable available to child processes as an environment variable.

Conditions (if, else) allow decision-making based on logic.

Loops (for, while) let scripts repeat tasks automatically.

Variables are temporary by default, but permanent variables can be added to ~/.bashrc or ~/.env_vars and loaded using source.

Scripts must be made executable using chmod +x.

Commands / Code
# Create script
nano script.sh

# Add shebang inside file
#!/bin/bash

# Run script
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh

# Variables
name="Godwin"
echo "Hello $name"

# Environment variable (permanent)
export role="DevOps Engineer"
echo $role

# Add to ~/.bashrc for permanent use
echo 'export role="DevOps Engineer"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# OR store in separate file
nano ~/.env_vars
export name="Godwin"
export role="Engineer"

# Load it
source ~/.env_vars

# If condition
if [ $1 -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "Greater than 10"
else
    echo "Less or equal to 10"
fi

# For loop
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Iteration $i"
done

# While loop
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
    echo "Count = $count"
    count=$((count+1))
done

Notes

Local variable: name="Godwin" (temporary, shell only)

Environment variable: export name="Godwin" (accessible to child processes)

source file loads variables or scripts in current terminal.

~ represents home directory.

./script.sh runs from current directory.

$1, $2 etc represent command-line arguments to scripts.

Bash scripting is heavily used in DevOps for automation, cloud provisioning, CI, backups, monitoring & server config.
