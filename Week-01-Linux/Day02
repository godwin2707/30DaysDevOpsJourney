Day 2 — File Operations & File Permissions

What I Learned

Basic file operations (cp, mv, cat, nano, vi) are used to copy, move, rename, view, and edit files in Linux.

nano is beginner-friendly; vi uses modes (i to insert, Esc to exit, :wq to save & quit).

Linux permissions use three roles: owner, group, and others — each with read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions.

chmod modifies permissions using symbolic or numeric (octal) values.

chown changes file/folder ownership (user and group).

umask controls default permissions for every new file/folder automatically, even if the user never manually sets it.

Default file permissions come from: base permission (666) minus umask (022) = 644.

Understanding permissions prevents common Linux errors like “Permission denied” and is essential for DevOps deployments and scripts.


Commands / Code

# File operations
cp file.txt copy.txt              # copy file
cp -r folder/ backup/             # copy folder
mv file.txt newname.txt           # rename file
mv file.txt ../moving/            # move file to another folder
cat file.txt                       # view file content
nano file.txt                      # open file in nano editor
vi file.txt                        # open file in vi (i = insert, :wq = save & quit)

# Check current permissions
ls -l                              # view permissions and ownership

# chmod (permissions)
chmod 755 script.sh                # rwx r-x r-x
chmod 644 file.txt                 # rw- r-- r--
chmod u+x file.sh                  # add execute to user
chmod g-w file.txt                 # remove write from group

# chown (ownership)
sudo chown user file.txt           # change owner
sudo chown user:group file.txt     # change owner and group
sudo chown -R user:group folder/   # recursive ownership change

# umask (default permissions)
umask                              # view current umask (typically 022)
umask 027                          # temporarily change umask

Notes

.. means “go to parent directory”; ~ means “home directory”.

New files do not get execute permissions by default for safety.

chmod numbers: 7=rwx, 6=rw-, 5=r-x, 4=r--.

Folders start from 777 before umask is applied; files start from 666.

umask runs automatically in the background — you don’t need to manually set it for it to work.

Correct permissions and ownership are critical when working with servers, scripts, logs, and deployments in DevOps.
