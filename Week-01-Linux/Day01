Day 1 — Linux Intro & Basic Commands

What I Learned

Linux is the foundation of DevOps because most servers, cloud systems, containers, and automation tools run on Linux.

Understanding the Linux filesystem helps navigate and manage configurations, logs, executables, and user environments.

Basic shell commands like ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, and rm are essential for moving around the system and managing files.

Linux has no recycle bin—commands directly affect the system, so careful execution is important.

Mastering these fundamentals is required before learning advanced DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.


Commands / Code

pwd            # show current directory
ls             # list files and folders
ls -l          # detailed list view
ls -a          # show hidden files
cd folder      # move into folder
cd ..          # move back
cd /           # go to root directory
cd ~           # go to home directory
mkdir project  # create directory
touch file.txt # create empty file
rm file.txt    # remove file
rm -r folder   # remove folder and contents

Notes

/etc contains system configuration files; /var holds logs; /bin and /usr/bin contain essential commands; /home stores user data.

Linux navigation is like learning the map of a city—DevOps engineers must be fluent in it.

These basics form the foundation for automation, deployments, debugging, and cloud operations.
