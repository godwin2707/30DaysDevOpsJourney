Day 3 — Users, Groups, sudo & Environment Variables
What I Learned

A user is an account in Linux; users have unique IDs and home directories.

A group is a collection of users used to manage shared permissions.

root is the superuser with full control; normal users need sudo for admin tasks.

sudo allows running commands with root privileges temporarily and safely.

Environment variables store values that programs and the system use ($HOME, $USER, $PATH).

The PATH variable tells Linux where to look for executables when commands are run.

Custom variables can store temporary or permanent values for automation and scripts.

Adding variables to .bashrc makes them persistent across sessions.

Commands / Code
# Users & Groups
whoami                     # current user
cat /etc/passwd            # list all users
groups                     # show groups of current user
sudo adduser testuser      # create new user
sudo groupadd devgroup     # create new group
sudo usermod -aG devgroup testuser  # add user to group

# Sudo
sudo command               # run command as root
sudo su                    # switch to root user
exit                       # exit from root session

# Environment Variables
echo $HOME                 # home directory
echo $USER                 # username
echo $PATH                 # directories searched for commands
printenv                   # list all environment variables

# Create variable
MYNAME="Godwin"
echo $MYNAME

# Permanent variable
echo 'export ROLE="DevOps Engineer"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
echo $ROLE

Notes

Users organize system access; groups help manage permissions efficiently.

Only use sudo when necessary — root access can break the system if misused.

$PATH is crucial; without it, every command would require full file paths.

Environment variables help store frequently used values or configuration settings.

Scripts rely heavily on variables to make automation flexible and reusable.

Add export in .bashrc to make your variables permanent.
